# Project Statement:

In a real estate environment, it can be easy to overlook the significance of a project manager‚Äôs role: to keep the project moving on schedule and under budget. In the past, some project managers had to justify their presence on a project site. But today, project managers‚Äô pay structure ‚Äî and the incentives for projects wrapping up as planned ‚Äî indicates that their value has proven itself over time.

# Project Description:

Real estate is considered real property that includes land and anything permanently attached to it or built on it, whether natural or man-made. There are five main categories of real estate which include residential, commercial, industrial, raw land, and special use. Investing in real estate includes purchasing a home, rental property, or land. Indirect investment in real estate can be made via REITs or through pooled real estate investment.

## Algorithm

##### Collabortive Filtering (Recommender Algorithm)
* Collaborative filtering filters information by using the interactions and data collected by the system from other users. It's based on the idea that people who agreed in their evaluation of certain items are likely to agree again in the future.
* When we want to find a new movie to watch we'll often ask our friends for recommendations. Naturally, we have greater trust in the recommendations from friends who share tastes similar to our own.
* Collaborative-filtering systems focus on the relationship between users and items. The similarity of items is determined by the similarity of the ratings of those items by the users who have rated both items.
* There are two types of collaborative filtering
    * **User-based**, which measures the similarity between target users and other users.
    * **Item-based**, which measures the similarity between the items that target users rate or interact with and other items.
    > I have used **user based** collaborative filtering in this project.
