# Project Statement:

The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch. The ML algorithms for these recommendation systems use the data about this user from the system's database.Nowadays, the recommendation system has made finding the things easy that we need. Movie recommendation systems aim at helping movie enthusiasts by suggesting what movie to watchwithout having to go through the long process of choosing from a large set of movies which go up tothousands and millions that is time consuming and confusing. In this article, our aim is to reduce the human effort by suggesting movies based on the user‚Äôs interests. To handle such problems, weintroduced a model combining both content-based and collaborative approach. It will giveprogressively explicit outcomes compared to different systems that are based on content-basedapproach. Content-based recommendation systems are constrained to people, these systems don‚Äôt prescribe things out of the box, thus limiting your choice to explore more. Hence, we have focused
on a system that resolves these issues
 
# Project Description:

Movie recommender systems are meant to give suggestions to the users based on the features they love the most. A highly performing movie recommendation will suggest movies that match the similarities with the highest degree of performance. This study conducts a systematic literature review on movie recommender systems. It highlights the filtering criteria in the recommender systems, algorithms implemented in movie recommender systems, the performance measurement criteria, the challenges in implementation, and recommendations for future research. Some of the most popular machine learning algorithms used in movie recommender systems such as K-means clustering, principal component analysis, and self-organizing maps with principal component analysis are discussed in detail. Special emphasis is given to research works performed using metaheuristic-based recommendation systems. The research aims to bring to light the advances made in developing the movie recommender systems, and what needs to be performed to reduce the current challenges in implementing the feasible solutions. The article will be helpful to researchers in the broad area of recommender systems as well as practicing data scientists involved in the implementation of such systems.

## Features 
* User can register and login.
* User can search through various movies and look through its details.
* User can give rating to the movies.
* User can add movie to their watch list.
* User can get movie recommendation (Recommendation algorithm (Collaborative Filtering) which suggests new movies based on the ratings given by user.)

## Algorithm

##### Collabortive Filtering (Recommender Algorithm)
* Collaborative filtering filters information by using the interactions and data collected by the system from other users. It's based on the idea that people who agreed in their evaluation of certain items are likely to agree again in the future.
* When we want to find a new movie to watch we'll often ask our friends for recommendations. Naturally, we have greater trust in the recommendations from friends who share tastes similar to our own.
* Collaborative-filtering systems focus on the relationship between users and items. The similarity of items is determined by the similarity of the ratings of those items by the users who have rated both items.
* There are two types of collaborative filtering
    * **User-based**, which measures the similarity between target users and other users.
    * **Item-based**, which measures the similarity between the items that target users rate or interact with and other items.
    > I have used **user based** collaborative filtering in this project.
